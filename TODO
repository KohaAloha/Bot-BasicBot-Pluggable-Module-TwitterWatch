* Avoid duplicate results if a tweet matches more than one search term.
  (Do the searching first, whacking results into a hash keyed on tweet ID, then
  go through and announce them at the end.)

* Add option to limit number of hits to relay, in case there's a lot of matching
  tweets all of a sudden

* Add option to exclude tweets based on a regex

* Add option to attempt to detect the language of the tweet and only relay it if
  it matches a set language

* Require user to be auth'd to issue commands
